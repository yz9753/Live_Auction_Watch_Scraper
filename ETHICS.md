## Ethical Considerations of Web Scraping for this project 

## Purpose of Data Collection 

The data for this project is collected from the LiveAuctioneers website, specifically for their auction listings for watches.  The primary purpose of this data collection is to create a practical example of web scraping to gain a deeper understanding as to what web scraping really is and to receive hands-on learning experience in data collection. 

## Best Practices for Ethical Data Collection 

1. **Respect robots.txt:** We adhere to robot.txt file of the LiveAuctioneer website, which only disallows specific user agents like Googlebot, Baiduspider, bingbot and other from accessing URLs that contains /*?/ and /munin*. 

2. **Rate Limiting:** To avoid disruption to the website's operations, we implement reasonable rate limiting of 1 second between requests in our scraping activities. 

3. **Privacy Policy Compliance:** We respect the website's privacy policy by not collecting any user data and not attempting to bypass the password protection. 

## Data Usage 

The data collected in this project is used for educational purposes only. If any data storage is required, it should be added to .gitignore file to ensure security and privacy. 

## Note 

While running this project, please respect the website policy and follow the collection practices outlined above to ensure ethical data collection and web scraping. For any questions or concerns regarding the ethical considerations of this project, please feel free to reach out!
