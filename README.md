# PPDS - Activity 02 - Live Auction Watch Scraper 

## Description 

This project is a web scraper that collects data on watches names and prices from a live auction website (LiveAuctioneers.com). The scraper includes a simple data feature prototype that allows users to specify their desired depth of the search as well as their target price range and then returns a refined list of watches to assit their purchasing decisions. 

## Key Features

- Retrives information about watch listings, including their name and price, from LiveAuctioneers.com.  
- Filters the watches based on user inputs (number of auction pages to scrape, target price range) and returns the resulting watch lists by price in ascending order. 

## Chosen Website 

The website we are using in this project is Liveauctioneers.com (http://Liveauctioneers.com). This website is selected because: 
1. It is authentic and provides up-to-date information about ongoing auctions 
2. It offers a huge collection of watches, featuring a wide range of brands and consistently updates its inventory 
3. The website structure is suitable for web scraping and its watch listings are publicly accessible, aligning with ethical scraping practices.
